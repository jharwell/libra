This is a repository containing 100% reusable cmake scaffolding that can be used
for nested/flat C/C++ projects (even mixing the two), and provides resuable
build "plumbing" that can be transferred without modification between projects.


Project documentation is `here <https://libra2.readthedocs.io/en/master>`_.
