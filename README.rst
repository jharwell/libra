This is a repository containing 100% reusable ``cmake`` scaffolding that can be
used for nested/flat C/C++/CUDA projects (mix and match), and provides reusable
build "plumbing" that can be transferred without modification between projects.


Project documentation is `here <https://libra2.readthedocs.io>`_.
